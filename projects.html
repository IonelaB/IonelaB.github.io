<h1>2009-2010</h1>
<p>I became a foreign exchange student and I spent an academic year in the US. It was the most beautiful experience I have ever had. It was so easy and exciting to for me to meet new people, to discover an absolutely new world and seek for better changes in my life. I felt very brave being thousands miles apart of my family and knowing that now is time to be independent and do everything by myself. Involving in a lot of activities like: gymnastics, debates, volunteering on helping kids to learn about Christianity, motivated me to get knowledge about a different culture from mine. I learned a lot during that year. I enjoyed all of my classes especially when learning about American history. </p>
