<h1>Where do I come from?</h1>
<p>I was born in a small and quaint town in the Northern part of Moldova, called Edinet. Its population is only thirty thousand people, and it is one of those towns where everybody knows everybody. Edinet is the kind of community warmly described in so many stories by the beloved Moldovan writer Ion Creanga, a place that hosts all your relatives and where people from the capital come for a provincial summer vacation. </p>

<h2>My childhood</h2>
<p>According to my family and to our large photo albums, I was a very active child, with unending curiosity and a taste for adventure. However, my real adventure began when I turned seven years old and started going to school. And this adventure gets more exciting with each day! Besides being busy with studying, I also became a young member of several clubs: the Dance Club, the Knitting and Sewing Club, the Painting Club, and the Debate Club. I participated in all these activities with great enthusiasm, and I try to maintain them to this day. Just recently I was fortunate to win an award in a painting contest at my school. The Dance Club helped me stay physically active, the Knitting and Sewing Club taught me useful skills, the Painting Club was a wonderful outlet for my creativity, but as I was maturing, I realized that I was particularly passionate about debate. The topics we got to research were fascinating: politics, health issues, the UN, human rights; and my thirst for knowledge was unstoppable. I firmly believe that debate not only helped me gain self-confidence, but also contributed to me becoming a more diverse person. It also brought some marvelous people into my life, so being a member of the Debate Club definitely contributed to my social life.</p>
<h3>Life Changing Event</h3>
<p>A life-changing event happened for my family in 2006: we decided to move to the capital – Chisinau. The reasons were multiple – from better living conditions to better schools to better health services. I remember the feelings of fear and discomfort I had when I realized I was leaving everything that was dear and familiar to me for this big, intimidating, and crowded city. However, my biggest culture shock came when I got enrolled in a new school and was part of a new group of pupils. To my surprise, adjusting to my new class was much more difficult than the work I had to do in order to get good grades. There were many things that were unusual about me to my classmates: my clothes, my way of communicating, my illiteracy when it comes to the latest teen slang terms. I suffered immensely because I was feeling like an outsider and I could not become friends with my classmates. I came to dread going to school; every day would bring new stressful interactions and jokes made at my expense. It occurred to me that I hadn't quite learned how to stand up for myself and that I had this belief that deep inside everybody is sincerely good. My mother kept telling me that, no matter what happens, I must always be good to people and genuine with myself, and between my frustration and my classmates' mockery, things slowly turned around. I made new friends, I found new activities, and I am greatly enjoying my new hometown. Furthermore, after spending a year in the United States as an exchange student, I realized that I had gained a new level of maturity that will prepare me for any surprise life may throw at me. All these past experiences have taught me a lot about myself, yet I can still relate to Lewis Carroll's words: "Who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle." So this marks the first chapter of my continuously evolving life story. I know there is so much more to discover, and this is what makes the puzzle so excitingly unpredictable.</p>
